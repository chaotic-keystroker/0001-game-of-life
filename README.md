# 0001-game-of-life
In this project, we aim to turn John Conway's game of life into a musical instrument. 

You can watch the [video](https://youtu.be/nZcqKzBLizo) on YouTube! Additional info in the video description.

In the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/chaotic-keystroker/discussions) you can reccomend what to do next and what should I imporove.

To interpret MIDI messages, you have to connect a synthesizer.
I used the OB-Xd synth - https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/

In the OB-Xd you can change presets in the menu. Select "Bank" (set of programs) and "program" which is a preset. You can also try to change the sounds with turning the knobs.
